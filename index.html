        <p>
          Federated Learning (FL) is an advanced machine‐learning paradigm in which multiple
          parties (clients) collaborate to train a shared model without exchanging their raw data.
          Instead of centralizing all data in a single repository, each client retains its own
          records locally and transmits only model updates (gradients or parameter deltas) to a
          coordinating server. This ensures that sensitive information remains within each
          organization, while still enabling the development of a robust global model that benefits
          from the unique insights of every participant.
        </p>

          In Singapore, HDB carpark capacity is generally sufficient at the national level, but
          local shortages can occur during peak hours, weekends, or special events. Although the HDB
          maintains aggregate occupancy statistics, relying on that data alone often yields
          suboptimal demand forecasts. By incorporating additional information from the Land
          Transport Authority (LTA), private ride‐hailing services such as Grab, and
          housing‐development agencies, predictive accuracy can improve significantly. However, each
          of these stakeholders are understandably hesitant to share raw records due to commercial
          sensitivities, privacy regulations, and data‐protection requirements.

          Federated Learning addresses this challenge directly. By training a joint model across
          HDB, LTA, housing‐developers, and Grab without exposing raw datasets, each organization
          can contribute valuable features (e.g., entry/exit logs, mobility patterns,
          housing‐occupancy rates) in a privacy‐preserving manner. The coordinating server
          aggregates these parameter updates and redistributes an enhanced global model, ensuring
          that no sensitive data ever leaves a participant’s secure environment. As a result, the
          final model can accurately predict parking demand at a local (estate) level—capturing
          both national “surplus” data and local “shortage” dynamics—while fully respecting each
          organization’s privacy constraints.

          Feel free to experiment with different client setups by toggling
          <strong>LTA</strong>, <strong>HDB Housing</strong>, and <strong>Grab</strong> in the
          Controls panel. Each combination represents a distinct federated configuration—observe
          how the global Test MSE and individual Client Contributions change as you include or
          exclude specific partners across your selected repetitions.

  <h3>Data Generation</h3>

  <p>
    We build a fully synthetic, yet realistic, parking-demand dataset by first creating
    1 973 geospatial “centroids” across Singapore. Public postal-code records from
    <em>data.gov.sg</em> are clustered via k-means (initially 2 000 clusters, trimmed
    to remove non-land regions) and tagged with 2019 Master-Plan planning areas to form
    our simulation grid. This ensures uniform spatial coverage while preserving real-world
    geography.
  </p>

  <p>We next generate four core feature families per centroid:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Housing & Population:</strong>
      Owner-occupied vs. rented household counts from the 2020 Census (Table 107) are
      mapped to each centroid.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Carpark Slots:</strong>
      2020 parking availability via Data.gov APIs, merged with 2025 HDB carpark locations.
      Coordinates in SVY21 are converted to WGS84 and assigned to centroids via KD-Tree
      nearest-neighbour lookup.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Resident Trips:</strong>
      Using Census “car only” mode shares (Table 104), we sample trip start/end pairs
      across centroids by cumulative-probability sampling proportional to car-usage rates.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Private-Hire Activity:</strong>
      “Taxi & private hire” mode shares yield Grab-ride counts per planning area, then
      distributed to centroids as above.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Finally, we compute a scalar “parking demand” per centroid by:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Min–max normalizing each feature to [0, 1].</li>
    <li>Applying human-tuned weights to reflect relative importance.</li>
    <li>Summing the weighted features to a composite score.</li>
    <li>Scaling to Singapore’s average occupancy (66.6 %), clipping negatives to 0.</li>
    <li>Multiplying by total lots available to yield absolute parking slots demanded.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The resulting “ground-truth” time series drives our federated-learning experiments,
    while preserving full compliance with PDPA and corporate privacy policies.
